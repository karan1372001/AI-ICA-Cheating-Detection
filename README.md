# AI-Based Cheating Detection in Online Games

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Foundations** module during my **MSc Computer Science** at **Teesside University**.

## Project Overview
Cheating in online multiplayer games reduces fairness and player trust.  
This project implements an AI-based system to detect cheating behaviour using reasoning-based artificial intelligence.

Player behaviour is analysed using gameplay statistics such as accuracy, headshot ratio, reaction time, movement speed, and player reports.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Reasoning-Based AI
- Rule-Based Systems
- Data Analysis & Visualisation

## AI Approach
- Gameplay statistics are converted into natural-language scenarios
- Reasoning-based AI classifies behaviour as:
  - Normal
  - Suspicious
  - Cheating
- Rule-based fallback system ensures reliability
